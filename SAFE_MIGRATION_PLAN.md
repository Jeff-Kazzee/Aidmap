# Safe Migration Plan for Live Deployment

## Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended for Hackathon)
1. Keep the current code that has the temporary fix
2. Only run the RLS policy migration for delete functionality
3. This keeps everything working without new columns

## Option 2: Full Migration (If you have time)
1. Run all migrations in Supabase
2. Update the code to use full functionality
3. Push to your Dev branch
4. Test thoroughly
5. Merge to main when ready

## Current Safe State:
- Delete works with just the RLS policy fix
- Close works by just changing status to 'completed'
- Admin panel works with existing columns

## To Apply Just the Delete Fix:
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable delete for users own requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own open requests"
  ON aid_requests
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'open');
```

This won't break anything and will make delete work immediately!
